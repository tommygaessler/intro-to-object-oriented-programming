# Pillars of OOP

1. Polymorphism
  - When a parent class implements a function that is implemented differently in a child class.
1. Encapsulation
  - controlling how data and behavior is accessed. Encapsulation also refers to hiding internal data that is not relevant to the user of a class.
1. Abstraction
  - Grouping functions into a logical set that represents something in the real world.


this is current context

property is dependent on instance, internal, color and size

state is the current objects well being, in instance at a certain time. broken ping pong ball vs normal pin pong ball.

instructor is like a factory that creates objects. Its like a template

methods functions that goes off all the instances

Polymorphism depends on content coming in

Encapsulation hiding variables and concerns away from the user. Not easy to do in javascript

Abstraction simplifying your code by taking different classes/sections out. Pull out distinct concepts, like weapon from ninja
